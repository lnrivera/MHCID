    <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
    <p class="copy">
      At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecdote in passing there.
      Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obsession with the odiferous bulb. Making many question whether there 
      was vampire trauma in his past.
